/*	Cucumber-It is a Framework
 	BDD--Behavioral Driven Development
	BDD Cucumber is widely used and grown fastly because even a Non-Technical person can easily work on it 
	
	*******************************************************************************************
	BDD cucumber has 3 components
	Feature File
	StepDefinition class
	Runner class
	*******************************************************************************************
	Feature File-English Language words
		         It is created based on User requirement
		         3/4 Steps
		         given is on Login Page						--preconditions
		         when enters a username and password		--actions
		         then user will be on HomePage				--output
		
	stepDef- It is for Implementation of above 3/4 steps--Java-Selenium code--written by Automation Tester
	
	Runner class -It is for code execution
	
	********************************************************************************************
	Feature File,Runner class can be written by Java Developer,Manual Tester,Business Analyst since it does not require Technical Knowledge
	Feature File has only one feature and multiple scenarios
	One scenario means one Test case

	Cucumber works on/requires Maven (we can add dependencies in Maven-->Selenium dependency.Java Dependency,Cucumber dependencies--cucumber-java,cucumber Junit,cucumber Gherkins,cucumber reporting,cucumber JVM deps)
	Maven is a Project Management tool
	Cucumber is mostly used with POM
	
	In cucumber,TestNG is not used generally...Junit used...Junit has only4 annotations
	Cucumber is a Framework.Hybrid Framework is also a Framework
		
	First we used to write all test cases in one class
	Then we have used POM---Pages in One class and Tests in another class
	Now BDD Cucumber
		
	TDD-Test Driven Development
	
	Smoke test cases---test cases which need to run daily
	Regression test cases---test cases which are run once in week, generally after update in web application
	performance testing
	functional testing
