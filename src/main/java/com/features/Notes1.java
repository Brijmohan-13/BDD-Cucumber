  parameterization is nothing but using test data/data table from feature file
  refer images
	
  test data can passed in three ways
  Examples --gherkin keyword(it is used the most because for every scenario we can write Examples )
  Excel    --see imgs
		   --thid is rarely used not required*/
			 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
//parameterization can be done for Register page(imagine)	
// successful log in can be checked by getting title of dashboard.And then comparing using Assert.assertequals(A,E)
//Assert.assertequals( , );  is written at end of test case.(passed/failed)
	
//only TestNG has the functionality to run the test cases parallel using testng.xml (NOT Junit)
//project pull means import
//project push means export
